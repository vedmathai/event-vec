Given a sentence and an event string in that sentence provide an estimate for the confidence on a scale of -3 to 3 that the given event happened, happens, or will happen, and the negative sign is to signify that the event is negated.

Here are three examples:
Example 1:
Sentence: It hasn't made merger overtures to the board.
Event String: made
Confidence: -2.54

Example 2:
Sentence 2: Details of the restructuring won't be made final until regulators approve the regulations mandated by the new federal act , the company said.
Event String: said
Confidence: 3.0

Example 3:
Sentence 3: And it stresses that every nation "has the duty to refrain from organizing, instigating, assisting or participating in terrorist acts in another state."

A set of important features are to see if the event is a speech event, whether it is in the subclause of the speech event, whether it has negation and whether it has a modal.
